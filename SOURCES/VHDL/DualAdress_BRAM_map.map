Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of 4 input LUTs:                16 out of   3,584    1%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:              8 out of   1,792    1%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:       8 out of       8 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of       8   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:          16 out of   3,584    1%
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:      16
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 24 out of      68   35%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       8
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.78

Peak Memory Usage:  219 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  7 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   7 secs 

Mapping completed.
